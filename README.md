# Chat
A chat room built for a grad networking course. It has a Command line interface.

## usage
Both the host and the user need to compile the source:

```makefile
make
```

Assuming that one is using this locally, then in one terminal run:
```node
./server PORTNUMBER
```
And in another terminal run:
```node
./client localhost PORTNUMBER
```

Interact! For further information, type 'help'.
